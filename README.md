# 👋 Hi, I'm Krishna Kanojiya

A Computer Science student driven by curiosity, discipline, and a deep appreciation for the intersection of technology, history, and human progress. I enjoy building software that actually solves real problems — from intelligent web applications to data-driven systems — while staying rooted in a mindset of continuous learning. I also draw inspiration from ancient Indian texts whose hymns describe profound accounts of creation and cosmic order — insights that, in my view, point to truths far deeper than what modern science has uncovered so far.
